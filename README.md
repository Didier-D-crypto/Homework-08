# Homework-08
Here you will find my personal website:
A deployed application highlighting through the input of an address, the climate of the environment the house presides in, 
while having databases of: 
1. Zillow : Used to obtain a price estimate for an address, as well as an estimated range of home values in the neighborhood, as well as a neighborhood average home value.
2. NOAA : The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's vast database of weather and climate data. Used to access and calculate relevant weather data for a user submitted area.
3. SmartyStreets : Used to find the FIPS code (a federal county identification code) that is used to collect data from the NOAA API since weather data isn't often available at the Zip or City level.
4. Google Streetview Static : Used to find the Streetview image of the user's address. 

Worked on front-end frameworks implementation such as Bulma and Bootstrap.
